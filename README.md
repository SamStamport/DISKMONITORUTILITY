# Disk Monitor Utility

Minimal scaffolding for the `disk_monitor.py` script in this repository.

- Purpose: simple utility to monitor disk usage and report alerts.
- Usage: run the script directly with Python:

```pwsh
python disk_monitor.py
```

- Dependencies: install packages from `requirements.txt` if needed:

```pwsh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want, I can:
- Turn this into a proper package (`disk_monitor/` package and entry point).
- Add tests or a small example config file.
- Inspect `disk_monitor.py` and add missing dependency imports.
